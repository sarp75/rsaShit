# rsaShit
Proving that RSA is shit-one step at a time

## Attacks
- Simple attack
  Runs well if you know e and N

## Factorisation
- Normal factor
  if n<2^64

- Fucking GNFS
  May take 2~6 months if your PC is real good

Note:
This is absolute shit, don't use this except the easiest shit like, idk picoCTF??
